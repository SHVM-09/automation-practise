# Contributing

Before starting to contribute to our automation script, it's recommended that you familiarize yourself with the following packages:

- [ChalkJs](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)
- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)
- [Globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby)
- [JSON5](https://github.com/json5/json5)
- [temp-dir](https://github.com/sindresorhus/temp-dir)
- [Minimist](https://github.com/minimistjs/minimist)
- Promise vs Async-Await (We use async await in this repo)
- Boolean props should be named using auxiliary verbs such as `does`, `has`, `is` and should. For example, `Button` components can use `isDisabled`, `isLoading`, etc.

These packages are already included in our package, so utilizing them in your contributions can make your work more efficient.

Additionally, it's essential to understand our utils functions before making any contributions. Here you can find utils:

```bash
